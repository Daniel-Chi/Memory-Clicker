# Memory-Clicker
Deployed at https://react-clicker-game.herokuapp.com/

Players must click images they have not already clicked while the page shuffles the images on each guess.
Each click stores information that lets the app keep track of which images have been clicked even though the images are shuffled.

This app accomplishes these tasks using the Facebook React library.
The app uses the framework provided by create-react-app and uses Bootstrap as well as custom css.
The app features a main App class component and several child functional components.
Information is dynamically manipulated and displayed with state and props.
The app passes functions from parent to child and uses conditional rendering to display game image tiles.
The app's logic demonstrates mastery over array and object methods and functional setState.
